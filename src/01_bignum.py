# Print out 2 to the 65536 power
# (try doing the same thing in the JS console and see what it outputs) 
# console.log(Math.pow(2, 65536)); --> Infinity
# console.log(Math.pow(3, 1000)); --> Infinity
# a value that is about 1.79e+308 or 2¹⁰²⁴— the largest value that can be stored as a number primitive type in JavaScript

# YOUR CODE HERE
# bignum = 2**65536 
# print(bignum)
